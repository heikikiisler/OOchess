# CEMLE - Chess Engine Machine Learning Experiment

Experimenting with machine learning applications on a simple chess engine.

### Overview

The goal of this project is to write a simple (and probably not very good) chess
engine. And then trying to improve it with the use of machine learning
algorithms and help from reputable engines in the role of an opponent or
evaluator. 

### Goals

- [x] Chess engine possible moves search
- [ ] Chess engine best move search with _n_ depth
- [ ] Chess engine UCI protocol game implementation
- [ ] Machine learning experimenting with config parameters
- [ ] Beat amateur player
