# CEMLE - Chess Engine Machine Learning Experiment

Experimenting with machine learning applications on a simple chess engine.

### Overview

The aim of this project is to create a simple (and probably not very
good) chess engine with the help of the [python-chess library](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess). 
The board evaluation function will be created by learning from a data set 
containing board positions with corresponding engine evaluations.

### Goals

- [x] Chess positions and evaluation data set
- [ ] Board parameters extraction
- [ ] Learn evaluation function from data
- [ ] Simple chess engine with UCI protocol
- [ ] Beat amateur player
